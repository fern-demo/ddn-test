This repository is a starter template for building documentation with [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com). It includes a sample Plant Store API to demonstrate how Fern generates interactive API reference documentation from an OpenAPI specification.

Use this template to get started quickly, then replace the sample content with your own API and documentation.

## What's included

This starter template contains everything you need to publish documentation:

<Files>
  <File name="docs.yml" comment="Configures navigation, theme, and hosting" />
  <File name="fern.config.json" comment="Sets your organization name and CLI version" />
  <File name="openapi.yaml" comment="Sample Plant Store API specification" />
  <Folder name="docs" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="pages" comment="Markdown content for your documentation" />
    <Folder name="assets" comment="Logos, favicon, and other assets" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

## Getting started

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone this repository">

```bash
git clone <your-template-repo.git>
cd docs-starter
```


</Step>

<Step title="Install the Fern CLI">

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
```

</Step>

<Step title="Preview locally">

Start a local development server with hot-reloading:

```bash
fern docs dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your docs.

</Step>

<Step title="Make it yours">

Update `fern.config.json` with your organization name and `docs.yml` with your desired URL:

```json title="fern.config.json"
{
  "organization": "your-org-name",
  "version": "0.46.15"
}
```

```yaml title="docs.yml"
instances:
  - url: your-org.docs.buildwithfern.com
```

</Step>

<Step title="Publish">

When you're ready to go live:

```bash
fern generate --docs
```

</Step>

<Step title="Cross-reference">
<Note>
As realm admin, run the `redcli` commands in the following procedure from any healthy node in your cluster.
</Note>

<Anchor id="procedure">**Procedure**</Anchor>

1. Determine the failed fan number using the following CLI command:

    ```bash
    redcli health event list -s CRITICAL
    ```

    The output of this command displays critical events, which include failed fans.

    For example, the following output shows that `(SYS_FAN_1)` failed:

    ```
    2025-01-21 03:26:43.73 +0000 UTC │ CRITC │ memp-dh4-inf-cug-7 │ Sensor hmi/servers/ c804086d-aad1-4869-8d2d-bcdcf9460952/sensors/8(SYS_FAN_1) Reading(140 5) crossed LowerCritical Threshold(150)
    ```

    The number displayed in the event output corresponds to the number shown in [Motherboard Layout](#figure-motherboard-layout) in [step 6](#locate-failed-fan-step-6). 

2. Put the instance with the failure into maintenance mode:
   
    a. List all resources of type instance in your cluster. In the output, a status of `present` indicates that the instance is not in maintenance. 
   
        ```bash
        redcli instance list
        ```
   
    b. Put the instance into maintenance by specifying its instance number or host name:
   
        ```bash
        redcli instance maintenance enter -i <instance_id>
        ```
      
        or
      
        ```bash
        redcli instance maintenance enter -n <hostname>
        ```
   
    c. List all resources of type instance in your cluster and verify that the status of the instance is `Maintenance`.
   
        ```bash
        redcli instance list
        ```

3. If the server with the failed fan is still running, power off the server by specifying its host name.

    ```bash
    redcli server power -T <hostname> -a off
    ```

<Anchor id="disconnect-power-cords-step-4"></Anchor>
4. Disconnect all power cords and cables. Ensure each cable is properly labeled to support correct reconnection in [step 11](#reconnect-power-cord-step-11).

5. Pull the chassis from the rack and remove the top chassis cover, as follows:
   
    a. Use a screw driver to loosen the captive screw on the rear of the chassis [Loosen captive screw](#figure-loosen-captive-screw).
   
        <Anchor id="figure-loosen-captive-screw">**Loosen captive screw**</Anchor>

        ![Loosen captive screw](../../../assets/ai2000-hw-guide/fan-replacement/Tyan_captivescrew.jpg)
   
    b. Slide the cover towards the back of the chassis, and then lift the rear top cover up, as shown in [Remove rear top cover](#figure-remove-rear-cover).
   
        <Anchor id="figure-remove-rear-cover">**Remove rear top cover**</Anchor>

        ![Remove rear top cover](../../../assets/ai2000-hw-guide/fan-replacement/Tyan_rearcover.jpg)

<Anchor id="locate-failed-fan-step-6"></Anchor> 
6. Locate the failed fan using the fan number from step 1 and the [Motherboard Layout](#figure-motherboard-layout) diagram.

    <Anchor id="figure-motherboard-layout">**Motherboard Layout**</Anchor>

    ![Motherboard Layout](../../../assets/ai2000-hw-guide/fan-replacement/sensor_location.jpg)

7. Physically remove the failed fan, as follows:
   
    a. Disconnect the fan cable from the motherboard header. 
   
    b. Lift the failed fan housing up and out of the chassis [Remove the failed fan](#figure-remove-failed-fan).
   
        <Anchor id="figure-remove-failed-fan">**Remove the failed fan**</Anchor>

        ![Remove the failed fan](../../../assets/ai2000-hw-guide/fan-replacement/Tyan_removefan.jpg)

8. Release the rubber screws and push pins from the failed fan, and then insert the same rubber screws and push pins on the replacement fan [Install rubber screws on replacement fan](#figure-install-rubber-screws).

    ![Install rubber screws on replacement fan](../../../assets/ai2000-hw-guide/fan-replacement/Tyan_rubberscrews.jpg)

9. Physically install the replacement fan, as follows:
   
    a. Align the replacement fan with the vacant slot in the chassis.
   
    b. Carefully insert the fan housing into the slot until it clicks securely into place. Confirm the fan is secure and seated flush in the chassis.
   
    c. Reconnect the fan cables to the same fan headers on the motherboard, using the following precautions:
       - Use care when inserting the fan connectors into the motherboard headers, as there are obstructions for some headers.
       - Avoid bending pins on these connectors.
       - Secure the cables using ties after fan replacement.

10. Re-install the top chassis cover and push the chassis into the rack.

11. Reconnect the power cords and cables exactly as they were removed in [step 4](#disconnect-power-cords-step-4).
